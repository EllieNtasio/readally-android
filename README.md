                                 Personal Library App ðŸ“š (Flutter + Firebase)
This is a Flutter app that allows users to create and manage their own custom book lists, functioning as a personal library.
Users can create new lists, add or remove books from these lists, and assign ratings to each book. 
The app uses Firebase for backend support, enabling features like data storage and synchronization across devices.

                                                 Features ðŸš€
Create and Manage Book Lists: Users can create multiple book lists (e.g., "Favorites", "To-Read", etc.).

Add and Remove Books: Books can be easily added or removed from any custom list.

Rate Books: Each book can be assigned a rating, helping users track their favorite reads.

Firebase Integration: Data is saved in Firebase and synced across devices, so users can access their book lists anywhere.

Search Books in Firebase Collection: Users can search for books from a Firebase-hosted collection and add them to their custom lists.

Simple and Intuitive UI: The app is designed to be easy to navigate with a clean and simple layout.
